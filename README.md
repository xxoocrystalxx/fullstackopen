## About Course

> This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development
> with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with
> ReactJS that >use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a
> section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs. The course covers
> testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for
> storing the applicationâ€™s data.

## Course

### Part 0 Fundamentals of Web apps

> In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking
> the course. After that we will have an overview of the basics of web
> development, and also talk about the advances in web application development
> during the last few decades.

### Part 1 Introduction to React

> In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we
> will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at
> some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

### Part 2 Communicating with server

> Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to
> render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we
> will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML
> forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the
> browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly,
> we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our
> React applications.

### Part 3 Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

> In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards
> implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement
> a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the
> application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this
> part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

### Part 4 Testing Express servers, user administration

> In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme
> will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have
> covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and
> authorization.

### Part 5 Testing React apps

> In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different
> possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based
> authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.

### Part 6 State management with Redux

> So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside
> React components. When applications grow larger, state management should be
> moved outside React components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux
> library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state
> of React applications.

### Part 7 React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack

> The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. First,
> we'll get familiar with React router. React router helps us divide the
> application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the
> browser's address bar. After this, we'll look at a few more ways to add CSS
> styles to React applications. During the entire course, we've used
> create-react-app to generate the body of our applications. This time, we'll
> take a look under the hood: we'll learn how Webpack works and how we can use
> it to configure the application ourselves. We shall also have a look at hook
> functions and how to define a custom hook.

### Part 8 GraphQL

> This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for
> communication between browser and server.

### Part 9 TypeScript

> This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript
> developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript. In this part, we
> will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to
> an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing
> TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop
> and configure projects using TypeScript.

### Part 10 React Native

> In this part, we will learn how to build native Android and iOS mobile
> applications with JavaScript and React using the React Native framework. We
> will dive into the React Native ecosystem by developing an entire mobile
> application from scratch. Along the way, we will learn concepts such as how to
> render native user interface components with React Native, how to create
> beautiful user interfaces, how to communicate with a server, and how to test a
> React Native application.
